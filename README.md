# Math Tutor
Math Tutor is program that allows a user to test its arithmetic skills for operations up to two digits. It runs in a terminal and presents the user with an initial menu. The choices presented are the list of subjects including addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulo, integer and real division. Other options are to review exercises previously completed or to exit the program. Each choice to practice is run as an exercise where the user is given the option to choose the number of questions. For each question the user has two chances to get the right answer. The first time is full credit, the second time is half credit or zero for the wrong answer. After completing each exercise the user is provided with a score report card and then redirected to the main menu. From there the user can choose to do more exercises or enter the exercise book to review the questions previously completed. The latter gives the option to review questions by subject, a specific exercise given it's number, delete an exercise or a summary of all completed exercises. The user can also choose to go back to the main menu to exit the program. Math Tutor is written in Ruby applying the principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
